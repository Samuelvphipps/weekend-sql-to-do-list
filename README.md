# PROJECT NAME

SQL To Do List

## Description

This is a todo list to keep track of tasks that need to be done. When a task is added it is displayed with older tasks submitted. On submission it is put at the top of the list. Items on the list can be marked complete which changes their status and also changes their background color to green for a more visual indication. Finally, to remove an item there is a delete button. THis button removes that task from the list altogether


### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- nodemon

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. npm start will run the server on 'nodemon'

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Type in a new task
2. Submit the new task which adds it to the list
3. When the task is complete, mark it completed.
4. When you no longer need that task on your list click delete to remove it.
